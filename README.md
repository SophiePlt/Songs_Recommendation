Collaborative Filtering for recommending Songs to Music Listeners

I use a dataset consisting of three .csv files, obtained from the Million Song Dataset Project, of derived user ratings of songs based on each user’s listening behavior. Each user only listens to a few songs, and therefore for each user we only have rating data concerning these few songs. Nevertheless, I would like to infer each user’s ratings of all songs based on the entirety of the data.
Finally, the goal is to recommend specific songs to specific users.
